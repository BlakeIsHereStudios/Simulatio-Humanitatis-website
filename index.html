            <h1>What the hell is this?</h1>
            <p>Simulatio Humanitatis is an open-source in-development 4X turn-based strategy game built with Godot, inspired by the <i>Civilization</i> series.</p>
            <p>By the way, "Simulatio Humanitatis" means "Simulation of Humanity" in Latin. It's a working title as of now, though.</p>
            <h1>So, when is it coming out?</h1>
            <p>Development takes a while, but a working build will eventually be available here. If you're tech-savvy and want to mess with the code or compile it yourself, a GitHub repository will be made as well.</p>
            <h1>Join the dev team!</h1>
            <p>This is currently a one-man project, but I do want more people to work on it. If you want to join the team, then make a pull request asking to join the team on the GitHub repository (when it comes).</p>
